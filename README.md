Simple raytracing implementation on the CPU based off of Peter Shirley's books. Utilizes a bounding volume hierarchy for optimization and supports spheres, quads, perlin noise, textures and local lighting via emitters. 


No longer working on it, as I'm building a new solution from scratch based on the algorithms and math in https://www.pbr-book.org/4ed/contents.
